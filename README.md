# OceanCleanUp_GA
Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which controls a simulated ocean cleanup agent. The LSTM-based agent navigates and collects plastic waste in a 2D environment with dynamic ocean currents and plastic hotspot distributions. Multiple GA runs are performed to evolve the agent's LSTM parameters
